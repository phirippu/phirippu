- 👋 Hi, I’m Philipp Oleynik (@phirippu)
- 👀 I’m interested in particle instruments, radiation detection, and embedded systems.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning VHDL and research automation routines, such as how to make lab measurements free from human <s>labor</s> intervention. I want to use VHDL in future particle instruments.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Geant4-based "instrument-simulation" code that should help laymen in C++ to simulate complex geometries.
